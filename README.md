# interview-algorithms-and-data-structures

A growing collection of JavaScript solutions for classic coding interview problems.

The goal is to build and strengthen problem-solving skills, one question at a time. Each file is written manually with clear logic.

## Structure

Problems are organized by topic:

- `arrays/`
- `strings/`
- `trees/`
- `dynamic-programming/`

Each file includes:
- A short problem description
- Example inputs/outputs
